	<h1>Yash Rana</h1>

	<h2>Aspiring Web Developer</h2>

	<p>I am a Technical Recruiter by the day and an aspiring Web Developer by the night. The quest started when I was working on a project of hiring few 'Full Stack Developers' for my client. As a part of the talent acquisition process, I learned more about
	web development. The more I learned, the more it fascinated me.</p>

	<p>I had to start somewhere. Career change is not an easy thing and boot camps are expensive; especially when you have a family to support. Thats when I came across <a href="https://onemonth.com/" target="_blank">'onemonth.com.'</a> A dollar for a week, seems pretty reasonable to sharpen the HTML and CSS skills that I self taught via <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">'Codecademy.com'</a></p>

	<p>Skills that I am currently working on:
	<ol>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
		<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>In my free time I like to make videos for my youtube channel. Like the one below:</p>
